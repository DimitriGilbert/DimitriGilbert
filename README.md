## $ cat about.txt

I studied English Civilization and Literature for a year. Dropped out. Worked in a factory.

Said "**fuck that !**" and decided to use my brain for something more interesting.

Self-taught Python in 2005. Always been a tech nerd. Coding felt natural from day one.

PHP dev for 2 years → Independent for 2 (full stack) → Lead dev (and dev ops, and repo master, and office grinch)  for 4.

Now? I build tools that make me less miserable. Sometimes they help other people too.

**cocorico !** 🇫🇷

## $ cat philosophy.txt

**Consensus:** Not consensual unless the consensus makes sense.

**TypeScript:** Best thing that happened to JS. Fight me.

**Open source:** Sharing my brain farts openly so maybe someone goes further or learns something new.

**Work:** Have fun but fill up the fridge is a must. Open to opportunities that dont suck ass.
